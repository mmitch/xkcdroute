title: check googlemaps ssl= parameter
desc: |-
  Check the contents of the ssl= parameter of the googlemaps URLs.
  Parsing of this parameter was added with commit
  8227759a8d607f8e43a4d0e3058d8fbbda6e8f35
  
  This might be a source location (sll= instead of ll=) as my latest
  tracking didn't guide me to my intended target but rather to my
  starting point.
