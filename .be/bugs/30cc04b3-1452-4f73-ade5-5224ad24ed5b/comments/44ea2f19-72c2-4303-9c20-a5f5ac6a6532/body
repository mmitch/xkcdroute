Check the contents of the ssl= parameter of the googlemaps URLs.
Parsing of this parameter was added with commit
8227759a8d607f8e43a4d0e3058d8fbbda6e8f35

This might be a source location (sll= instead of ll=) as my latest
tracking didn't guide me to my intended target but rather to my
starting point.
